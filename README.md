# What is this?
    It's a little project that was made in accordance to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths) curriculum. It is a responsible holy grail layout with content section that consists of multiple cards that are positioned differently in correspondance with current viewport. Decided to put it out since I'm very proud of how it turned out.
